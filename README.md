=====================

Rubber Ducky script and it's payloads for SCN

23008809

## Overview
------------

A project designed to not only execute code on a system, but exploit for root, utilise root to leave a backdoor and exfiltrate data out. Purely designed as a demo project, with no actual malicious intent other than against the VMs to test against.

## Files
--------

* `pyproject.toml`: The project's configuration file, which specifies the build system and dependencies.
* `src/ducky/runroot.sh`: A shell script that is executed by the Rubber Ducky USB device to set up the environment and run the payload.
* `src/server/main.py`: The main entry point for the FastAPI server, which provides additional payloads to the Rubber Ducky USB device.
* `src/server/payloads/clipboardWatch.py`: A payload that watches the clipboard for sensitive information and exfiltrates it to the FastAPI server.
* `src/ducky/rootEXEC.py`: A Python script that is executed by the Rubber Ducky USB device to perform additional tasks and interact with the FastAPI server.
* `Makefile`: makefile which prepares ducky script, copies and updates ip and vars in scripts. 

## UV requirements
* `pyproject.toml: requirements used for the fastapi server, you can use the docker container instead to have everything precompiled

Use: ```uv sync``` to setup package requirements

## Usage
-----

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory.
2. Run `make` to generate the script for the Rubber Ducky USB device.
3. Load the .dd script onto Ducky
4. Insert the Rubber Ducky USB device into a target computer.
5. The script will execute and download additional payloads from the FastAPI server.

## FastAPI Server
----------------

Fastapi servers exfiltration endpoints as well as payload downloads

## Payloads
------------

* `clipboardWatch.py`: Watches the clipboard for sensitive information and exfiltrates it to the FastAPI server.
* `analyser.py`: Exfiltrates data about targeted machine
